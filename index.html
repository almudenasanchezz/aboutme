            <h3>I am Almudena SÃ¡nchez Gallego and I am 22 years old. During my childhood and adolescence I have lived in Toledo, the place where I was born.
                <p>
                    I moved to the Valencian Community at the age of 17 to study Industrial Design Engineering and Product Development at the UPV.
                <p>
                    Currently, I am doing the ID3 (Interactive Digital Development Design) postgraduate course at ESAT, since I have always been interested in the digital world and the operation of different platforms.
                <p>
                    I have always been a curious person, eager to learn and give my best. I also consider myself close, empathetic and I enjoy helping others. This is how I would define myself in a few words :)    
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Why me?</h2>
                <h3>
                    I can carry out technical design engineering projects and design new products taking into account each of the phases of the design process.
                    <p>
                    On the other hand, I also develop digital products and focus on their proper functioning.
                    <p>
                        Also, I always like to give my best in each project because I feel the need to feel fulfilled and satisfied with my work. I am one of those people who maintains an active listening based on the client's preferences in order to achieve their purpose and meet their expectations, an aspect that I have worked on a lot during my university years.
